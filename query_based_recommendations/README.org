* About
** Doc2Vec Approach
We will do it for English. We will have a dataset with reviews. User will give input and we will find the corresponding restaurant for them.

Input data: (Description, HotelID)
Output data: Hotel ID
process: Doc2Vec to find similar document

What are we training? A Doc2Vec model.
** Clustering Approach
We will cluster the hotels into three categories based on their reviews - Elite, Medium, Low cost. Then we will do classification based on review given.

Input: Description, Category
Output: Category
Process: Classifier

** Multimodal approach

Clustering to find approximate one + Doc2Vec to find exact one
